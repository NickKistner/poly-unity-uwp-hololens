# Poly UWP SDK for Unity

I wanted to integrate Poly in our Unity App for HoloLens and noticed that it isn't supported for UWP.
So i decided to take a look at the SDK and built a working solution for UWP builds.

I initially commited the original SDK in version 1.0.3 where my changes are based on.

# Notice the following things:
* The SDK only supports listing and importing for public assets, private assets and login in Poly-Account does not work anymore!
* Change to .net Scripting Backend
* Change to Scripting Runtime Version .net 4.6
* Insert your API Key
* Enjoy!
